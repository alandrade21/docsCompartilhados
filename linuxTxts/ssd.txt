- no arquivo /etc/fstab, o SSD deve ser montado com a opççao relatime
- Install sysfsutils
- echo "block/sdX/queue/scheduler = deadline" >> /etc/sysfs.conf
- Verifica se o sistema reconheceu SSD

# for f in /sys/block/sd?/queue/rotational; do printf "$f is "; cat $f; done
/sys/block/sda/queue/rotational is 1
/sys/block/sdb/queue/rotational is 1
/sys/block/sdc/queue/rotational is 0   <=== Only this is SSD!

- Verifica sucesso do deadline

for f in /sys/block/sd?/queue/scheduler; do printf "$f is "; cat $f; done
/sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler is noop deadline [cfq]
/sys/block/sdb/queue/scheduler is noop deadline [cfq]
/sys/block/sdc/queue/scheduler is noop [deadline] cfq  <== That is!
